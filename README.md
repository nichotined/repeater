# Repeater

A terminal-based application that leverages `browser-use` to automate repetitive web-based tasks.

## How It Works

1. Interact with AI to navigate to a website.
2. Continue the conversation until your objective is achieved.
3. Once finished, the application saves the entire session.
4. You can replay the saved session later.

## Use Case

This can be especially useful for QA purposes, as replaying a session is similar to running regression tests.
